![MaximumBatteryCapacity](imgs/MaxCap.png) 

### EV Charging and Discharging Controller
The "EV Charging and Discharging Controller" feature allows users to define the charging and discharging behavior of up to four electric vehicles (EVs) within a Streamlit application. The feature is implemented using Streamlit's st.form() function to create a user interface that can be easily filled out by the user.

![SingleInput](imgs/EV1_InputControl.png)

Within each of the four columns, the user can expand an "EV Charge" and "EV Discharge" section. Within these sections, the user can specify the start and end times for charging and discharging, battery levels, and charge and discharge multipliers.

![Alt Text](imgs/FullInputControl.png)

This feature provides users with a simple and intuitive way to input and define the charging and discharging behavior of multiple EVs within their Streamlit application. The input parameters collected through this feature can then be used for further analysis or processing within the application.

### Plot Tool
The "Plot Tool" feature provides users with a convenient and efficient way to visualize the charging and discharging behavior of up to four different electric vehicles (EVs) in the system. By displaying the charging and discharging behavior of each EV over time, users can easily identify any potential issues or imbalances that may arise in the system.


![plot](imgs/Plot.png)
Additionally, the plot includes information such as the `PV (W)` output, `Imbalance (W)`, and `Total_Imbalance (W)`, allowing users to gain a comprehensive understanding of the system's overall performance.
<div class="warning" style="width: 100%;">

$${TotalDemand (W)} = {General Demand (W)} + {Heating Demand (W)}$$

$${Imbalance (W)} = {TotalDemand (W)} + {PV (W)}*NumberPV$$

$${TotalEVCharge (W)}={\sum_{i=1}^4 EVCharge_i (W)} $$

$${TotalEVDisCharge (W)}={\sum_{i=1}^4 EVDisCharge_i (W)}  $$

$${TotalImbalance (W)} = {Imbalance (W)} + {TotalEVCharge (W)} + {Total EVDisCharge (W)}$$

$${SOC_i (W)} = {InitialCharge_i (W)} + {} + {EVCharge_i (W)+{EVDisCharge_i (W)}}$$

</div>
The multiselect dropdown menu enables users to select the EVs they wish to view on the plot, providing a customizable and user-friendly experience. By allowing users to select specific EVs, they can focus on the vehicles that are most relevant to them, saving time and improving productivity.
![dropDown](imgs/DropDown.png)
Overall, the "Plot Tool" feature provides users with a powerful tool to visualize and analyze the performance of the EV charging and discharging system, helping to ensure optimal system performance and efficiency.

## Daily Power Exhcange Analysis
The 'Daily Power Exhcange Analysis' feature provides a user-friendly and interactive plot tool for visualizing the charging and discharging behavior of up to four different electric vehicles (EVs). The tool is contained in a container object and divided into three columns, each displaying a different type of plot.

The first column shows a bar plot that displays the total energy exchange for each individual EV, with the charging values represented in blue and the discharging values in red. The x-axis labels are customizable and the energy values for each car are displayed on the plot.
![Plot1](imgs/Plot1.png)

The second column displays another bar plot that shows the total energy exchange for all EVs combined. The energy values for total discharge and total charge are displayed and can be customized.

![Plot2](imgs/Plot2.png)

The third column contains a pie chart that shows the proportion of energy coming from photovoltaics (PVs) and from the grid. This provides a quick and easy way to see the source of energy for the EVs.

![Plot3](imgs/Plot3.png)

The energy source logic is based on the following equations:

- If EV_charge > 0 and TotalImbalance < 0, then there is extra energy produced by the PVs and moved to the EVs:

    PVs --> EVs

- If EV_charge > 0 and TotalImbalance > 0, then the energy is coming from the grid:

    Grid --> EVs

The above equations determine the energy flow direction based on the state of charge of the EVs and the total energy imbalance in the system. The code uses these equations to calculate the energy source and classify it as either from the PVs or from the grid, which is then used to generate a pie chart showing the proportion of energy from each source. 


Overall, this tool is a useful and intuitive way to visualize the energy exchange for multiple EVs and can be easily customized to display different data.
### Battery View
The 'BatteryView' creates 4 expanders that display the battery level of 4 different electric vehicles (EVs) and a graph of their battery level over time. 

![expadners](imgs/expander.png)

Each expander consists of two columns, where the left column shows the starting and ending battery level of the charging session for the corresponding EV, while the right column displays a graph of the battery level over time.

![battery1](imgs/battery1.png)

### Download CSV file for further analysis
For any given day in the calendar year the user can simulate the Charging and Discharging for up to 4 Evs and visually see and evaluate the scenario. For further analysis a scenario that would involve multiple days in a row can occur. 

![downloadCSV](imgs/downloadCSV.jpg)

Dowload csv file is a feature where the user can download the corresponded dataset for any set of parameters at any given day . 
### Analysis Dashboard
The Analysis Dashboard is a feature in DailyEVPlanner that allows users to upload scenarios and receive calculations on various aspects. It provides information on the SOC at the end of the day, the impact of charge and discharge on the imbalance curve, and statistics on green energy penetration and curtailed energy. It helps users make informed decisions based on these insights.

### PV production estimation PVGSIS

Data is collected from PVGIS and Solcast for the duration (27-4-23 and 3-5-23)

Using a linear regression model i am trying to train a machine learning model to predict the PV production given a set of paremeters

- **TimestamptMinute**: This column represents the minute component of the timestamp. It indicates the specific minute of the hour for a given data point.
- **TimestamptHour**: This column represents the hour component of the timestamp. It indicates the specific hour of the day for a given data point.
- **TimestamptMonth**: This column represents the month component of the timestamp. It indicates the specific month of the year for a given data point.
- **TimestamptDay**: This column represents the day component of the timestamp. It indicates the specific day of the month for a given data point.
- **CloudOpacity**: This column represents the cloud opacity. Cloud opacity refers to the extent to which clouds obstruct sunlight. It indicates the amount of cloud cover at a particular time.
- **Dhi**: This column represents the diffuse horizontal irradiance. DHI refers to the amount of solar radiation received from the sky dome scattered by the atmosphere. It represents the solar radiation received from all directions except the direct sun.
- **Dni**: This column represents the direct normal irradiance. DNI refers to the amount of solar radiation received per unit area from the direction of the sun on a surface that is perpendicular to the sun's rays. It represents the direct solar radiation.
- **Ebh**: This column represents the estimated actual horizontal irradiance. EBH refers to the amount of solar radiation received on a horizontal surface.
- **Ghi**: This column represents the global horizontal irradiance. GHI refers to the total amount of solar radiation received on a horizontal surface, including both direct and diffuse solar radiation.

![predictionImage](imgs/predictionMOdel.jpg)

As you can see the model outputs a model that follows the flactuations of a PV production (High Production during dat and almost zero duting night)</br>
TO DO LIST
-  The predictedPV should be compared with the acutal readings from the region for the specified timeline .
- More features regarding weather data can be used ex(wind Speed).
- Connect API from PVGSIS and SOLARCAST so i can retrive data for any location and time period .

<!-- The pie chart that shows the proportion of energy coming from photovoltaics (PVs) and from the grid.

The graph has two areas: one area represents the energy charged from green sources, while the other represents energy charged from non-green sources. 

There are blue horizontal lines on the graph that indicate the battery capacity levels of the EV (20%, 80%, and 100%), and a red horizontal line indicating the maximum battery capacity of the EV.

## Future Work

- Creating a database: 

    Currently, the tool reads data from CSV files, which can be time-consuming and may not scale well for larger datasets. In the future, it would be beneficial to integrate the tool with a database such as MongoDB or Snowflake to allow for faster and more efficient data storage and retrieval.

- Battery limitations:

     The current version of the tool generates charge and discharge profiles without taking into account the maximum capacity of the battery. In future versions, we could consider incorporating this limitation into the model.
     - One approach would be to generate profiles that are within the battery capacity limits, by adjusting the generation algorithm to take the maximum capacity into account.
     - Alternatively, create a function that corrects the generated profiles to ensure they are within the capacity limits (0, MAXIMUM_CAR_CAPACITY).
     
- Between charge and discharge timestamps the car has to drive certain amount of km in order to reach destination . For every car a slider can be created that will determine the travel distance between charge and discharge in km and will reduce battery capacity accordingly.
- Better Functions for plotting maybe create a Plotter class instead of generating the plots into the main function
