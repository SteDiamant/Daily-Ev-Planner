    st.markdown("""Hey there! I'm Stelios Diamantopoulos, a 27-year-old electrical and electronic engineering student from Greece, now based in the Netherlands. I'm passionate about data analytics and business, having recently completed a fascinating minor in the field.

Driven by the belief that daily consistent effort leads to extraordinary results, I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities. When not immersed in my studies, you'll find me indulging in sports, martial arts, chess, and programming.

I've had enriching experiences as an intern at Rosen Group B.V., a teacher assistant at Saxion University, and an electronic engineer at Roboteam Twente.

My projects, like the 'Daily Ev Planner' and 'Generating SVG Defects for MEM Device Visual Inspection,' reflect my dedication to innovative solutions.

Certified in Matlab Basics, Data Analytics, and Advanced Business Intelligence, I'm committed to continuous learning and growth.""")
